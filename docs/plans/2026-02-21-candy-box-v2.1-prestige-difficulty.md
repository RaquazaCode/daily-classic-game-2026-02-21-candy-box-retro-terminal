# Candy Box Retro Terminal v2.1 Implementation Plan

> **For Implementer:** Optional process aid: use superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task.

**Goal:** Add prestige/meta progression, unobstructed playfield UI relocation, and multi-difficulty longer runs while preserving deterministic hooks.

**Architecture:** Keep deterministic authority in `src/game.ts`, move menu/upgrade/command UI to DOM side docks in `src/main.ts` + `index.html`, and keep `src/render.ts` gameplay-only.

**Tech Stack:** TypeScript, Vite, pnpm, Playwright scripted capture.

## Delivery Checklist
1. Add difficulty/meta/prestige types and constants.
2. Add persistent meta logic and chip rewards in game simulation.
3. Move UI components out of canvas into dock panels.
4. Keep hooks stable and expand snapshot payload.
5. Refresh scripted determinism captures and docs/README/repo metadata.
